# Fractals-at-Institute-of-Nuclear-Physics-in-Cracow
Results of scientific workshops at IFJ PAN in Cracow.
The code was created by Jakub Halfar and me under the eye of Phd Eng Paweł Oświęcimka (https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=i2uGj0YAAAAJ&hl=pl).
Our goal was to use box-counting method in order to calculate fractal dimension of an object shown on a picture.

We focused on 4 domains: 
1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) - we succeeded to notice a notable change in fractal dimension of brain picture before and during dementia.
2. Paintings of Jackson Pollock - we found a significant change in fractal dimension between his early artworks (figurative to some extent) and his subsequent (and most famous) works, which were entirely abstract, yet somehow fractal. Fractal properties of Pollock's art were observed by many researchers earlier, that's why our algorithm has proven its reliability.
3. Analysis of city infrastracture from a bird's eye view - we processed maps and tried to find fractal properties in layout of streets and buildings.
4. Analysis of stock chart, which is said to also have presumably some fractal properties.

Everything happend in 2022, thanks to scholarship program "Krajowy Fundusz na Rzecz Dzieci", which I have pleasure to be part of.
